 - In this course they will teach us the ESSENTIALS and the VIOLATIONS in terms on accesibility

 - ACCESSIBILITY: It means that people with disabilities can equally perceive, understand, navigate and
		  interact with websites and tools.

 (ACCESSIBILITY IS USABILITY FOR ALL - Interaction design foundation) 
 (ACCESSIBILITY IS ESSENTIAL FOR SOME, BUT USEFUL FOR ALL - Wai) 
 
 - USABILITY: It means a product is intuitive, efficient, delightfull, easy to understand,
	      free of frustrations, asthetic, modern looking.


 - ACCESSIBILITY will give you design constraints that will lead to better products for all of your users.

 (USABILITY on it's own often does not sufficiently address the needs of people with disabilities. - Wai)


 - This course will teach you how to seamlessly integrate accessibility in your design process.

(you should always say: PEOPLE WITH IMPAIRMENTS, never say disabled people or impared people)
