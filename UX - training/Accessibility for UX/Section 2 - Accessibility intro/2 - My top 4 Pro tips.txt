 1 - Accessibility is essential for some, but useful for all.

 2 - The secret is to think in terms of addressing peoples’ difficulties and problems, 
     not in terms of following a standards checklist to the letter.

 3 - It’s not designing for edge cases:
     When we’re designing, it’s tempting to think that we are designing for “regular” users first, 
     and then making alterations to accommodate users who have disabilities; like they are edge cases 
     we have to compromise our core design for.

 4 - All usability issues are exacerbated if you have a disability.
     And “accessibility” should be considered part of the definition of “usability”.
