 1 - My users don't complain about accessibility, so we must be doing ok.
     If users aren't complaining, maybe they are clicking away instead.

 2 - Fixing accessibility is expensive, isn't it?
     It's ideal to do the job right at first so you don't have to pay to fix it later.

 3 - The market is just to small to justify time and effort.
     In the UK there is 12 million people with disability.

 4 - Accessible design means boring design.
     Embracing accessibility can open up innovation. 
     Should work well for those that need it and be invisible for those that don't.
