1 - Drive Innovation

“The accessibility problems of today are the mainstream breakthroughs of tomorrow.” — Eve Andersson, Google


2 - Minimize Legal Risk

Many countries have laws requiring digital accessibility, and lawsuits against non-accessible websites are increasing.


3 - Enhance Brand Reputation (company or personal)

We all have a circle of influence of at least 100 people. People we can tell about our good/bad experiences. 
A better brand reputation means more people want to buy our products or use our services.

For organizations: Diversity and inclusion efforts are accelerated with a clear accessibility commitment. 
We want to stand out as leaders.

For individuals: No one is perfect, but when you work to design for optimal accessibility, 
and then share the story of your efforts, that sets you apart. That is a differentiator for your personal brand 
(aka your reputation as a UX practitioner).


4 - Extend Market Reach and Revenue Possibilities

There are over 1 billion people around the world with disabilities. And they have a considerable 
spending power of more than $6 trillion U.S. dollars (which is over 5 trillion Euros, and 447 trillion Indian Rupees).

Market to people with disabilities - share the story of your efforts around accessibility.


5 - Improve Websites' Search Engine Rankings

Accessibility best practices also benefit your SEO (Search Engine Optimization). 
And an accessible website is a mobile-optimized website. 
Google down-rates websites that are not mobile-friendly (aka responsive).
