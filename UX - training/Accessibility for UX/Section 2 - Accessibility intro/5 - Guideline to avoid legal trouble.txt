There are multiple degrees of compliance a group can aim for: Level A, Level AA (double A), 
or Level AAA (triple A). Level A being the most lenient and Level AAA being the most strict.

- For example, if you design digital products for U.S.-based businesses or organizations, 
then you should know about these two U.S. laws:

Section 508 which covers government agencies and organizations in receipt of government 
funding such as universities.

This is a section of the federal law that mandates certain electronic content (and other things) 
conform to the accessibility standards of WCAG 2.0 Level AA. (More about who this applies to in the next lecture.)

- The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) which covers businesses and, most often, their websites.

Title III of the ADA mandates that places of public accommodation need to be accessible to those with disabilities. 
In court, “public accommodations” has often included publicly accessible websites and other digital products.

- Another example, if you design digital products for European-based businesses or organizations, 
then you should know about...

The EU Web Accessibility Directive (EN 501-349) which is binding on all member states of the European Union. 
It requires all government and public sector organizations funded by governments to keep their websites accessible. 
In 2018 this was updated to reference the WCAG 2.1 Level AA.
