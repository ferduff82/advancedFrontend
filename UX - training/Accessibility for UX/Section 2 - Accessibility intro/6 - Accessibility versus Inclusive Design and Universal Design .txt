If the default theme has insufficient contrast, 
then many will not be able to perceive that another option is available to them. 
So the option that works for more people is never observed by them. 
(Note: There’s nothing wrong with providing a theme that’s of higher contrast than the default, 
as long as the default has sufficient contrast itself, which in the case of Instacart, it does not.)
