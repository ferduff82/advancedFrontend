1 - Use the grayscale test, to see if the data visualization can still be interpreted without the 
benefit of color.

2 - Still use color, since color-coding benefits people without vision impairments, just make 
sure color is not used ALONE to convey the differences.

3 - Use different pattern fills (when the area is large enough for a pattern fill to be seen), 
and make sure the pattern color and the background color have a 3:1 contrast ratio.

4 - Use different dashed/dotted line styles (and/or line widths) for line graphs. Different line 
widths work when thereâ€™s a limited number of lines thus allowing the widths to be obviously different from one another.

5 - Use different shapes for data points (for line graphs or node graphs).

6 - Use relative luminance, where each color has a 3:1 contrast ratio with all of the other 
colors of the color-coded part of the data visualization. A monochromatic color scheme 
(all shades of 1 color) can make this easier to achieve when you have a lot of parts.

7 - Add the values next to the data points when possible (e.g. next to each line, pointing to 
each pie slice, hovering over each bar). These can be available by default for simple data 
visualizations, or triggered on hover/on tap for visualizations that are more data-heavy.

8 - When possible: Use interactivity to make it easier to get the specific value and/or label 
for each data point. Also, use interactivity to show a line/area/region isolated on hover/tap 
making it easier to see individual parts of the chart.
