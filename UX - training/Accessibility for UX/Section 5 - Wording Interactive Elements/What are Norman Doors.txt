- What Are “Norman Doors”

I’ve already introduced you to Don Norman, but do you know about “Norman Doors”?

They are a great physical world example (or demonstration) of affordances vs. perceived affordances.

A Norman Door is a door whose design tells the person to do the opposite of what they're actually supposed to do.

In the usability world, when someone compares something to a Norman Door or calls it a “Norman Door”, 
they are saying it’s a usability fail.
