The 10 Fundamental States to Design
What Are All of the States That Need to be Designed?
Well, if you go to WCAG and look up “states”, this is what WCAG will tell you:

A state is a: Dynamic property expressing characteristics of a user interface component that may change in response to user action or automated processes.

States do not affect the nature of the component, but represent data associated with the component or user interaction possibilities. Examples include focus, hover, select, press, check, visited/unvisited, and expand/collapse.

Allow me to translate for you, because you know I’m not going to just leave you with the rulebook definition and send you on your way!

The basic fundamental states to design for are:


Default / Enabled

Focus

Hover

Pressed / Active

Visited → for links (or borderless buttons)

Disabled

Selected / Toggled (aka: activated, expanded)

Processing (aka: loading, working)

Abort (aka: cancel, terminate)

Error → for form elements
